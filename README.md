# Secret Couple Detector üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Bug Off!

### Project Description
A playful computer vision project that exposes ‚Äúhidden romances‚Äù in a classroom. Using head pose estimation and gaze detection, the system identifies when two people stare at each other for over one second and captures the moment ‚Äî frame by frame ‚Äî for evidence.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you scientifically prove who‚Äôs making googly eyes at whom during class without awkwardly staring at them yourself?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI snitch that watches the class, detects mutual stares, and saves those exact frames. Basically, CCTV meets gossip.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- *Languages:* Python
- *Frameworks:* OpenCV, Mediapipe, YOLOv8
- *Libraries:* NumPy, Ultralytics, dlib, imutils
- *Tools:* Roboflow (annotation & dataset), Jupyter/VSCode for development

For Hardware:
- None ‚Äî this project is entirely software-based
- Just a PC/Laptop with GPU (recommended for faster processing)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

# Clone this repository  
git clone https://github.com/username/secret-couples-detector  
# Navigate into project folder  
cd secret-couples-detector  
# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Run

# Run the main head detector (processes video + triggers gaze detection)
python head_detector.py

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
