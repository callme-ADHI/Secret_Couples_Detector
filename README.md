# Secret Couple Detector üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Bug Off!

### Project Description
A playful computer vision project built specifically for classroom surveillance to uncover only the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù couples.By measuring the physical distance between detected students and combining it with head pose estimation & gaze detection, the system filters out random glances and catches only those who sit suspiciously close and stare at each other for over a second.The results are automatically deployed in a Streamlit web app, where the evidence is displayed ‚Äî frame by frame ‚Äî for maximum classroom gossip impact.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you scientifically prove who‚Äôs making googly eyes at whom during class without awkwardly staring at them yourself?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI snitch that watches the class, detects mutual stares, and saves those exact frames. Basically, CCTV meets gossip.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- *Languages:* Python
- *Frameworks:* OpenCV, Mediapipe, YOLOv8, Streamlit
- *Libraries:* NumPy, Ultralytics, dlib, imutils
- *Tools:* VSCode 

For Hardware:
- None ‚Äî this project is entirely software-based
- Just a PC/Laptop with GPU (recommended for faster processing)

##Algorithm
- Person Detection (YOLOv8 : )Detects all students in the frame and marks their bounding boxes.
- Head Pose Estimation (Mediapipe/dlib)Determines the yaw (left/right rotation) of each detected head.
- Distance Filtering : Calculates the Euclidean distance between two people‚Äôs positions.Only pairs sitting within a set proximity threshold are considered potential couples.
- Mutual Gaze Detection : Checks if both individuals in a close pair are facing each other for more than 1 second.
- Evidence Capture : Saves the frame and tags the ‚Äúcaught‚Äù couple when conditions are met.
- Streamlit Deployment : Publishes all caught moments in a live web dashboard for instant viewing.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

# Clone this repository  
git clone https://github.com/username/secret-couples-detector  
# Navigate into project folder  
cd secret-couples-detector  
# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Run

# Run the main head detector (processes video + triggers gaze detection)
python head_detector.py

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
